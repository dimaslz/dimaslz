/*
I'm a tech geek, with more than 10 years of experience as a FullStack software developer.

Enthusiastic and proactive, I have an entrepreneurial mindset, always involved in some side projects in my free time to keep learning and discover new challenges.

Skilled in multiple technologies and platforms (backend, infrastructure, databases, frontend, android, ios, desktop), I am able to adapt to the needs of the team.

As an employee, I am empathetic and aware of the product as a whole. I like to understand the business model and the team's goals, to be more productive and proactively think something about what could be a benefit for the user or the project. I like to learn, work and contribute with my code and my positive and supportive attitude.
I like to be a mentor when needed and, I like to be mentored as well.
